# ML_churn_predictive_model

Every week I will publish a new project to demonstrate my skills and abilities to prospective employers.

This week, I decided to create a machine learning model with Tensorflow to predict where or not a costumer is likely to churn. 
To check out the project open an .ipynb file.

Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, TensorFlow and Sklearn

This is not a full example of what I would do but has been made to give you a rough idea about my thought process. Please let me know if you have any questions/advice. 

This is my first GitHub project so go easy on me ðŸ˜Š
